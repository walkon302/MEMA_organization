    "# Purpose and the use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "MEMA can be used to study impacts of microenvironment on many cellular responses, including cellular morphological changes, drug responses, and cellular organization. MEMA images are processed either by CellProfiler or Python and generate the spreadsheet containing all the measurements. While most of the measurements are single-cell level data, which can be analyzed directly; cellular organization patterns are multiple-cells level information, which cannot be readily included in the result of the MEMA images analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "It takes time to manually classify the MEMA images to different organization patterns and label each image with either well-organized or disorganized. Thus, the goal of this project is to develope a method to automate the process of labeling images with organization patterns for facilitating further MEMA analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This automation can be intergrated into MEMA analysis pipeline or be used individually to access the cellular organization patterns in other experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use case 1: For the MEMA experiments\n",
    "After applying this method, the MEMA images are classified into different organization patterns. We can then use this information to study which microenvironmental components play important roles in cellular organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use case 2: For other experiments\n",
    "After applying this method, we will be able to quicktly quantify the ratio of organization patterns in the experiment."

    "# Overview\n",
    "There are two major goals:\n",
    "1. Image classification:  \n",
    "Let users use trained model to do image classification.\n",
    "2. Model fine-tunning:  \n",
    "Let users to fine-tune the model for better results on different cell strains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Image classification\n",
    "Once the model has been trained using well-defined images, the trained model can be used directly to classify organization patterns. This part of scripts will include the following functions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Loading:  \n",
    "It takes one folder containing MEMA images, pre-processes them for prediction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction:  \n",
    "It predicts the labels for each image in the folder from the previous step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Report:  \n",
    "It generates csv or spreadsheet for downstream analysis and a summary html report.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model fine-tunning\n",
    "Since the model is trained by certain cell strains, and the organization patterns may vary accross different cell strains, the model need to have the flexibility to be fine-tunned by the images from the new cell strais to do better job on classification. This part of scripts will include the following functions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data loading:  \n",
    "It takes two folders, one with well-organized cell images, and another with disorganized cell images, preprocesses them for tuning the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tunning:  \n",
    "It feeds the trained model with data from previous step to fine-tune the parameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output the model and report:  \n",
    "It outputs the tunned-model for image classification and a summary html report with cross validation accuracy before and after model tunning."
